# WGU BSCS Class List
A class list with resources, tips and tricks.

At this time all the information within this repo is curated from [WGU-IT Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B1S7OJNChk1-cWhwNWZTb2JNY1E)

The hope is to be able to selectively sync BSCS classes with the WGU-IT Drive.
